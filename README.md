Project:  SQL scripts for "The Israeli Knesset" Dataset




1. What the project does:


A tool I developed for my project: "The Israel Kneseet by Generations"

These are PostgreSQL queries for the "knesset_main" dataset I created in my other project: Knesset Members - HTML-TXT Decompiler



2. How to start working woth the project:


Copy the content of the file "Knesset_Main_Ini_Creation_Sample_200.txt",
Directly paste into SQL query for a sample of 200 out of 3,190 rows.
